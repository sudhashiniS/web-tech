    <P>Bala was introduced by lyricist Arivumathi to director Balu Mahendra. Initially, he began working as a production assistant under him. Later Bala turned to work with him as assistant director in his movies. Bala made his directorial debut with Sethu in 1999, that gave a break to Vikram, the film's lead actor, who was also struggling in the Tamil film industry for almost a decade without a hit and recognition. More than 60 distributors saw the film and hesitated to screen it because of its tragic ending. The film was released on a low profile without any advertisement but after the first days the film started running to packed houses just through 'word of mouth'.The film was said to have initiated a 'new wave' as it received critical acclaim and became a hit. Its success led to remakes in Kannada (Huchcha), Telugu (Seshu), and Hindi (Tere Naam) languages.</P>
